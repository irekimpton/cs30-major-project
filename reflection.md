Overall, I'm considering this assignment/project/journey-of-self-discovery was a giant success as I didn't lose my mind entirely,
and the code
technically functions!
I had a number of issues over the course of the course, mostly just trying to get stuff to work codewise, but also my laptop hating me
I could never get my laptop to actually load my code and assets, so I couldn't really work at home.
I got around this with the power of lunch hour, but I think I could have gone a few extra steps to make it awesome if I could have.
The other issues were purely programing, almost all collision detection. getting all the different things to interact with all the
different set pieces and all the math behind it was my biggest problem, but once I got it I could reuse the same math other places.
I learned a lot as a programmer, mostly working with arrays, objects, and especially classes.
